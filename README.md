# Libft
Libft is an exercise in fundamentals and discipline: you learn to think like the compiler, understand memory, and write clean, reusable, and efficient code.

Libft is the first major project at 42 School, and its goal is to make you build your own C library by re-implementing many of the standard library functions.
The idea is to truly understand how C works under the hood — from memory manipulation to strings and pointers.

Throughout the project, you rebuild classic functions like strlen, memcpy, and atoi, and also create new utility functions that make programming easier, such as ft_split and ft_strjoin.
After that, there’s a bonus part: implementing linked lists from scratch, working with structs, pointers, and callbacks.

The final result is a library called libft.a, which can be used in other 42 projects (like get_next_line and ft_printf) or in any C program you decide to build.
